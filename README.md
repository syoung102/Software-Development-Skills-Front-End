### During Exchange Student
I made a website that shows my exchange student life.
- You can see the courses that I'm taking at LUT.
- You can see the activites that I did in Lappeenranta
- I share a Google map of famous places in EU countries I traveled to.
- You can see how to contact me

There was a problem on my website that my website could not show all sentences because there were many long sentences such as 'Activities in Lappeenranta'. <br>
To solve this problem, I created a website that responds to 'more' diverse screen sizes.
